# Distributed MapReduce in Golang
---

This project implements a distributed MapReduce framework using Golang. It is developed as part of the Distributed Systems coursework at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the principles of distributed computing through a practical implementation of MapReduce. The system distributes tasks across multiple nodes, processes data in parallel, and aggregates the results.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Task Scheduling:** Efficiently assigns tasks across multiple nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Handles node failures gracefully.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale with additional resources.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
